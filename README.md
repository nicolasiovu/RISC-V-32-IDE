A RISC-V 32 Assembly IDE being written in Java.

Here are some goals:

- Step through functionality
- Live register view
- Live memory view
- Custom text editor themes

More ambitious ideas:

- "Pipeline" view (see what stage instructions are in as you step through)

Hopefully this can be an all around good educational tool for beginners to assembly, with the comfort of a lightweight text editor but visualization features for proper debugging.
